        <p>Games like football have been played around the world since ancient times. The game came from England,
         where the Football Association wrote a standard set of rules for the game in 1863.</p>     
         <img src="image1.png">
         <p>The game originated in China, for their army. The players had a very heavy ball and goals high.
         England took the idea of the Chinese game and changed the rules a bit and now it is the modern game we know today.</p>
         <p>Each team has 11 players on the field. One of these players is the goalkeeper,
         the only player who is okay to touch the ball with their hands. The other ten are known as "outfield players". The players try to kick the ball into their opponents' goal.</p>
